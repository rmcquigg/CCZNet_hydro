## This respository contains:

Datalogger process codes for the hydro group of the Coastal Critical Zone project group. Scripts are Python and contain components that are specific to our project and internal database.

LTC.py contains most functions for processing a Solinst LTC file and updating DB tables (see LTC documentation).

Note: Jupyter notebooks do not always render properly here. If it's not working for you, copy the URL and paste at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view.

Direct questions about anything here to Rachel McQuiggan rmcquigg@udel.edu
